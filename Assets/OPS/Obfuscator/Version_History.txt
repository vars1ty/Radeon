4.0

== Obfuscator 4.0 Introduction ==

The Obfuscator 4.0 version is a bottom up new implemented Obfuscator, to increase the performance, security and
compatibility to Unity 2018+ versions. For you the process keeps the same. The Obfuscator still automatically applies
the obfuscation at build time. The Setting and Error-Stack-Track windows got a face lifting to be more intuitive and easier
to use. The settings and rename-mapping are now stored in a Json serialized file. This means for you,
because of the modification and the extension of the settings, you have to readjust the settings in the settings window.
It is not necessary to change the rename-mapping files. They will still be normally interpreted. But new rename-mappings
will be stored in the new Json format.

Most important obfuscation changes:
- You have more options to decide which assemblies you want to obfuscate.
- The string obfuscation is now way more advanced. (Pro only)
- The obfuscation of MonoBehaviour/ScriptableObject/Playable subclasses is way more advanced too. (Pro only)
- Also inspector set values / methods are now even better recognized.

and 'Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll'. (Do not forget to activate the obfuscation of those
through the belonging settings, in the Obfuscator Settings General Tab, after updating!!)
- Update: Third party assembly Mono.Cecil got an update.
- Pro: Removed: Removed the 'OPS.ObfuscatorAssets.dll' assembly located in the 
'OPS\Obfuscator.Pro\Editor\Plugins' directory, it is now part of the 'OPS.Obfuscator.Editor.dll' 
assembly. (Depending on the used Unity Editor, you have to remove the assembly 
'OPS.ObfuscatorAssets.dll' manually after updating!!)

3.9.4
- Pro: Fix: Unity obfuscation had a small artifact causing build errors, fixed that.
- Fix: NullPointer Exception in the Assembly analysation phase. (sorry for that!)

- Pro: Improvement: String obfuscation.
- New: Suppress Debug through Visual Studio.

- Add: You can now obfuscate serializeable field.
